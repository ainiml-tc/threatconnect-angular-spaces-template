## Usage

```
cookiecutter https://github.com/fhightower-templates/threatconnect-angular-spaces-template.git
```

## Prerequisites

1. cookiecutter (required)

You will need to install [cookiecutter](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter). This can be as easy as `pip install cookiecutter`, but there are other options available in the [cookiecutter documentation](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html#install-cookiecutter).

2. bumpversion (optional)

[Bumpversion](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/bumpversion) is really handy for incrementing version numbers. This app template is designed to work with bumpversion so that the following commands will increment the version number of the app appropriately:

- `bumpversion patch`
- `bumpversion minor`
- `bumpversion major`

You can read more about bumpversion [here](https://github.com/peritus/bumpversion#bumpversion).

## Details

This app is based on the example app [here](https://github.com/ThreatConnect-Inc/TCX_-_ExampleContextApp).

Feel free to raise an [issue](https://github.com/fhightower-templates/threatconnect-angular-spaces-template/issues) if you find anything wrong or have a suggestion.

There is a similar version of this template to create spaces apps using Javascript here: [https://github.com/fhightower-templates/threatconnect-js-spaces-template](https://github.com/fhightower-templates/threatconnect-js-spaces-template).
